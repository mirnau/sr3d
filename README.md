# SR3D

SR3D is a Shadowrun Third Edition Homebrew game system. In Foundry Virtual Tabletop (VTT), a game system is essentially a modular software package that defines the rules, mechanics, and data structures for a specific tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). 

## What is Shadowrun Third Edition
Shadowrun 3rd Edition is a cyberpunk-fantasy tabletop role-playing game set in a dystopian future where magic has returned, blending high-tech with arcane powers. Released in 1998, it refines the core mechanics of its predecessors, focusing on the interplay between hacking, combat, and magical systems. Players take on roles like hackers (deckers), street samurai, or spell-slinging mages, navigating a gritty world dominated by megacorporations, cyber-enhanced mercenaries, and ancient, awakened creatures. The game uses a d6 dice pool system, emphasizing strategic planning and resource management while diving deep into rich lore and immersive world-building.

## What is Foundry VTT?
This system targets Foundry VTT, and can not be built or run withouth the Foundry VTT software and licence. A VTT (Virtual Tabletop) is a digital platform designed to simulate a tabletop gaming experience online. It allows players to collaborate in role-playing games (RPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun, even if theyâ€™re geographically separated.

Foundry Virtual Tabletop is a web-based application built primarily with JavaScript, utilizing HTML and CSS for its user interface. It operates on a Node.js server, leveraging Electron to provide a desktop application experience. For data storage, Foundry employs LevelDB, a fast key-value store, to manage game data and assets efficiently.
