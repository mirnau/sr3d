A Shadowrun 3d Homebrew System for FoundryVTT.

The goal is to make a fully functional system for the rule and dice heavy game system Shadowrun. This is my first project where I work with JavaScript and I am learning by doing, yet feeling quite at home due to experience in other languages.

I have worked in this for a couple of days and am still very much at the beginning of this project as the scope was bigger than I thought, for more fully fledged projects that are well documented, please have a look at my portfolio:
